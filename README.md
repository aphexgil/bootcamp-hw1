Gil Young Homework 1 - Horiseon Refactor

Refactored code for an SEO and social media marketing company's website. Made the site more accessible by adding descriptive alt text to all images and icons on the page that can be read by screen readers. Also fixed broken links, consolidated redundant group styles, and wrote comments for both the HTML and CSS  pages.
